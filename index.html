            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                After completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering I decided to return home and use
                my skills to make a difference in my country. Over the years I garnered experience working for companies and on
                projects which gave me the resources and skills needed to build my own platform in 2019.
                Every job challenged me to bring out a different side of me. None of the jobs required the same competencies
                but they were all in the computer science field and mainly software development. I got into Mobile app design
                and development, web design and development, scripting, and then full-stack web development. With this rich
                experiences I would like to use what I know to make your company grow. I have tilted toward software engineering
                with special interest in the technologies that run behind most of the applications we use daily.
                I am a passionate learner and I love looking for solutions to problems. Computer engineering gives me the tools I
                need in order to think critically and find possible solutions to some of the most complex problems in our societies.

                    237 First Music Services<br>
                    2020 - 2022 (2 years)<br>
                    237 First Music Services is a one-stop music service online. On this platform artists could upload their
                    songs, set the way they wanted their songs to be distributed and the options were free download, sell,
                    and stream. Once the content was distributed on the platform, viewers statistics would be recorded and
                    made accessible to the artist such that they could know who views, downloads and buys their music.
                    Music could be uploaded in video and audio format. Also, lyrics and sheet music could be released on
                    the platform.
                    237 First Music Services is the first music ecosystem in Cameroon. With this system, artists produce at
                    a cheaper price such that they have more money to promote their music. Why this? It is an innitiative
                    that solves one of the biggest problems in the Cameroon music industry which is promotion. Generally,
                    artists spend alot of money recording professional songs and videos. According to 237 First Music
                    services statistics of the rate of productivity of the Cameroon Music Industry, more videos are released
                    monthly than audio songs. Professional videos cost alot more than audio recordings therefore artists
                    spend alot more to release content over time but once this content is done and released then comes the
                    problem of promoting it.
                    Our platform offered affordable digital marketing for artists. Music distribution on platforms like our
                    partner company Boomplay and through independent distribution channels. Our payment gateway was
                    available to 8 African countries and through Visa and Master Card.
                    After running the business for close to two years, we had financial problems and I decided to put the
                    business on a hold, get a job, raise more funds, garner more experience and employ specialists to
                    develop the new version of the platform.
                    Philip Makebeh - page 1I gained skills in Digital marketing, full stack web development, strategy and alot more skills. I would like
                    to use the skills I garnered to get a full time job which will enable me save up money.

                <p>
                    Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock<br>
                    2017 - 2019 (2 years)<br>
                    At this job I got to experience every section of computer engineering. I worked at hardware
                    maintenance, network admininstration and software development. My job required that I keep all the
                    office computers updated. I was called in case of any hardware issues.
                    In addition to hardware maintenance, I worked with the networking team to setup the office network. We
                    in charge of making sure our offices constantly had network and that our remote services were always
                    running.
                    Moreso, I worked with the systems administration team to write scripts that would verify the integrity of
                    files before they get into the server. On the occasion which we were supposed to configure hundreds
                    of tablets, I was incharge of writing a program that will automate the process. I used powershell to write
                    scripts that would install software on several computers at once.
                    This job gave me the opportunity to develop more skills like maintenance, troubleshooting, network
                    maintenance and systems administration.

                    Cameroon Gallery<br>
                    2018 - 2019 (1 year)<br>
                    Cameroon Gallery is an ecommerce site on which you can buy African goods. I worked here as a
                    webmaster and content creator for over a year. My job required that I keep the website up-to-date with
                    recent content. With my experience in Php, HTML, CSS and Javascript I was able to edit the sites's
                    design to fit our needs. In addition to editing the front-end, I was in charge of taking pictures of the
                    content found in our store.
                    Sellers would come to us to sell their content online. We would register their content in our system,
                    include it in our online and offline store and promote the products on our social media for customers to
                    see.
                    This job enabled me to be dynamic, creative and well versed with Wordpress CMS. I spent alot of time
                    developing the front-end using HTML, CSS and JS. Also, this job made me appreciate art more. I met
                    frequently with the artists behind the artworks. We did interviews with them at their workshops where
                    they would give us insight about their artwork.

                    My task was to build an application for the company's web portal. They required that information
                    should reach their personel on phone. Messages, news and more had to be delivered through push
                    notifications.
                    built the application using Codename One which was the popular solution for building hybrid mobile
                    applications at the time. Coding in Java was fun because it was favorite language at the time.
                    I worked with the guidance of senior developers in the company.
